Then in a second pass of the data another dictionary containing all the popular pairs above the given support threshold from the first pass is created. This is programmed using functional programming practices and completes large files in a reasonable amount of time. Fun fact is that it does not contain a single loop in the program! (support threshold is the minimum number of times an item must appear in the transactions to be added to the respected dictionary.",

The first is a basic scuba diver and fish, which just focuses on object composition, connected shapes/structures, and animating the shapes/structures using a timestamp and sin and/or cos functions. The second is 3 rabbits dancing around a fire. This time around I implemented textures and converted my ADS shader to a fragments shader for smoother lighting. Also animated the camera to move around the scene and also switch the lighing from Phong to Blinn-Phong lighting",
